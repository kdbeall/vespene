Vespene
=======

Vespene is a reimagined build system and automation console, focused on ease of use and advanced
capabilities.

Vespene was designed with extremely large micro-service deployments in mind, but it equally usable
for all kinds of IT environments.

While new, Vespene is growing quickly. All ideas for improvement are fair game!

Features
========

* A horizontally-scalable architecture built on Python, Django, and PostgreSQL
* A well-organized, straight-forward user interface
* Distributed workers
* Built-in graphically-configured CI/CD pipelines - no DSLs to learn
* SSH-agent integration lending script access to encrypted SSH keys
* A flexible variable system with Jinja2 templating and integration with any tool that can consume YAML/JSON
* Webhooks and scheduled builds
* Easy-to-configure access controls
* Self-service automation panels for all types of users
* Docker or sudo-based build isolation for security
* Triggers to publish builds, run checks, or send messages to Slack
* A plugin system where nearly everything is extensible - 8 types of plugins to date!
* Easy administration, deployment, and upgrades

Status
======

Currently Vespene is in "beta" status.

You should feel comfortable running off the master branch today, and reliable 
database migrations are in place to enable easy upgrades.

Our first release branch release will be in January of 2019, with new releases following approximately 
every 3 months.
